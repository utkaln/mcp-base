    "title": "The Economics of BitCoin Price Formation",
    "summary": "This paper analyses the relationship between BitCoin price and supply-demand\nfundamentals of BitCoin, global macro-financial indicators and BitCoin\nattractiveness for investors. Using daily data for the period 2009-2014 and\napplying time-series analytical mechanisms, we find that BitCoin market\nfundamentals and BitCoin attractiveness for investors have a significant impact\non BitCoin price. Our estimates do not support previous findings that the\nmacro-financial developments are driving BitCoin price.",
